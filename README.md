# Learning Resources

This repository serves as a list of resources that I have personally found useful for learning about certain concepts - especially those discussed in the low level javascript videos. Where applicable, the resource will be annotated with a media type and description. This list will forever be a work-in-progress, and I'll do my best to keep it updated as I think of/find interesting resources!

## Contributing

If you'd like to add your own informative (and relevant) resources, feel free to open a PR! I'll merge it if I think it fits with the spirit of the repo.
