# Driving LED Panels

I've recently gotten interested in driving LED panels from an FPGA. These panels are typically combined in larger quanities to create large video wall displays. You can buy the individual panels cheaply from sites like Aliexpress (a 64x64 display is something like â‚¬20!).

Here are a few resouces that I've been referencing:

  - This video shows some of the first principles of driving panels, with the demonstration being built using gateware-ts.
