# General Learning

Learning about low level topics can be quite overwhelming, because the subjects are actually very broad. The key thing that helps me learn when I feel out of my depth reviewing a resource is to accept that I might not (and probably won't) understand everything from it at once. That's fine. Exposing myself to the terminology and concepts creates a cummulative understanding over time. I look up terms on wikipedia - despite what some people say, wikipedia is one of the worlds greatest achievements. If I don't understand the terms O find on the wikipedia page, then I open up all the links in new tabs, and fall down the rabbit hole until things start making sense!

## Keeping A Journal / Lab Notebook

Keeping notes as you learn - be it in a real notebook, a wiki, or just a text file - is frustratingly effective. When you're working on something hard, you can write about what you want to do, what you found, the problems you ran into, etc. It makes it so easy to look back at what you've done. It's also one of the worlds most effective debuggers. When you hit a problem you don't understand - you can apply the scientific method:

1. Write down your observations of the system
2. Form a hypothosis about what the problem might be
3. Design an experiment to test the hypothosis (this can be as simple as `console.log('here?')`
4. Run the experiment
5. Return to step 1

Using the above methodology, you will undoubtedly end up understanding the system better. If you're so inclined, you can transform knowledge gained in this way to tests for your system - allowing you to see when something you thought was true later breaks down under different conditions.

As a final point, lab notes can be make for some of the most interesting blogs! They allow you to showcase your problem solving skills, and I personally have a lot of respect for people who show their entire process.

## Don't try to learn in a black box

As a quick note, some people will, when working on a project - perhaps from misplaced principles - actively avoid reading other peoples code when trying to solve a problem; I've been guilty of this myself as well. But it really is a *life hack* to get past that pride - because not only will it speed you up dramatically, it will likely reveal to you other, perhaps better ideas. This isn't stealing (at least as long as you're not ripping code out directly or actively trying to avoid attribution!) - this is learning! Discovery feels great, but sometimes you're doing youself a disservice by avoiding the hard work that others have already done.
