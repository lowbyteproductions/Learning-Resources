# FPGA and HDL

- [nandland](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsdA-aNqtMA1_2T15aXePWw)
  - A YouTube channel that specifically teaches FPGA and HDL from the very basics up to some more advanced projects. There's also a blog which has code and more detail about the concepts discussed in the videos
- [Robert Baruch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBcljXmuXPok9kT_VGA3adg)
  - Robert makes a lot of interesting videos, some of which are specifically about building CPUs on FPGAs. His HDL of choice is nMigen, which is a python based embedded hardware description language. Check out the `6800 CPU with nMigen`and the `LMARV` series.
- [Ferris](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4mpLlHn0FOekNg05yCnkzQ)
  - Ferris is a demoscener and rust enthusiast, who also happens to be creating his own embedded HDL in rust, and using it to create a game console on an FPGA. He streams all of his work and uploads it to youtube. His other videos are also well worth checking out!
- [gateware-ts](https://github.com/gateware-ts/gateware-ts)
  - I can't help but plug my own TypeScript based HDL here! `gateware-ts` is an ongoing effort to make it possible to create FPGA hardware in TypeScript - and is designed specifically to work with the open source toolchain. It's still quite rough around the edges - it doesn't have much in the way of documentation (though some can be generated from the code), and the toolchain must be installed separately - but it's coming along quite nicely. Check out the examples folder to get an idea of how it looks.
